Probably don't need a whole repository just for this, but it's easier than hosting on the website and convenient to keep citations in one place. Citations are in order of appearence in the presentation.

**Title slide:** Figure taken from Chesebro et al. Challenges and Frontiers in Computational Metabolic Psychiatry. (in press). [Preprint](https://www.cambridge.org/engage/coe/article-details/66b531f95101a2ffa89ec0ff) (yes I know the citations are messy - ask me for a cleaned version or wait a month until it's published).

**Slide #1:**
1. Image taken from the tool presented in Gryglewski et al. Spatial analysis and high resolution mapping of the human whole-brain transcriptome for integrative analysis in neuroimaging. _Neuroimage_. 2018 Aug 1;176:259-267. [doi: 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2018.04.068.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1053811918303884?via%3Dihub)
2. Image taken from Chesebro et al. Ion gradient-driven bifurcations of a multi-scale neuronal model. _Chaos Solitons Fractals_. 2023 Feb;167:113120. [doi: 10.1016/j.chaos.2023.113120.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37662556/)
3. Image adapted from Kula et al. D-êžµ-hydroxybutyrate stabilizes hippocampal CA3-CA1 circuit during acute insulin resistance. _PNAS Nexus_. 2024 May 16;3(5):pgae196. [doi: 10.1093/pnasnexus/pgae196.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11138115/)
4. Image take from Mujica-Parodi et al. Diet modulates brain network stability, a biomarker for brain aging, in young adults. _Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A_. 2020 Mar 17;117(11):6170-6177. [doi: 10.1073/pnas.1913042117](https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.1913042117?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&rfr_dat=cr_pub%20%200pubmed). 
5. Image generated with DALLE3 using ChatGPT. I'm lazy and just typed in two prompts to get this.

**Slide #2:** Mostly unpublished data - ask me if you're interested in details. Gene maps illustrated from Gryglewski et al. Spatial analysis and high resolution mapping of the human whole-brain transcriptome for integrative analysis in neuroimaging. _Neuroimage_. 2018 Aug 1;176:259-267. [doi: 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2018.04.068.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1053811918303884?via%3Dihub)

**Slides #3-5:** Various figures excerpted from Chesebro et al. Ion gradient-driven bifurcations of a multi-scale neuronal model. _Chaos Solitons Fractals_. 2023 Feb;167:113120. [doi: 10.1016/j.chaos.2023.113120.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37662556/)

**Slide #7:** Animations are in `probability_flux_animation.jl` and `quick_neuron_animations.jl`. For the second one you'll need Neuroblox installed, but you should really get it for all your neuron animation needs anyway so win-win!

**Slide #8:** http://www.physics.adelaide.edu.au/theory/staff/leinweber/VisualQCD/ImprovedOperators/index.html

**Slide #9:** 
1. Images adapted from Byrne et al. A mean field model for movement induced changes in the beta rhythm. _J Comput Neurosci_. 2017 Oct;43(2):143-158. [doi: 10.1007/s10827-017-0655-7](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5585324/).
2. Unpublished internal simulation (ask me if you want code/demo).
3. Video from supplementary material of Pang et al. Geometric constraints on human brain function. _Nature_. 2023 Jun;618(7965):566-574. [doi: 10.1038/s41586-023-06098-1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10266981/).

**Slide #10-12:** Unpublished data (and some ongoing experiments). If you're interested in details or want to get involved, get in touch! A couple extra resources (and citations from other papers on the slides):
* [Scientific machine learning and physics-informed neural networks](https://book.sciml.ai/notes/03-Introduction_to_Scientific_Machine_Learning_through_Physics-Informed_Neural_Networks/)
* [Simulation-based inference](https://sbi-dev.github.io/sbi/latest/tutorials/00_getting_started/) (not mentioned directly in talk but very close to the topic)
* Brincat SL, Miller EK. Frequency-specific hippocampal-prefrontal interactions during associative learning. _Nat Neurosci_. 2015 Apr;18(4):576-81. [doi: 10.1038/nn.3954.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4444366/)
