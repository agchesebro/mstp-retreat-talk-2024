Probably don't need a whole repository just for this, but it's easier than hosting on the website and convenient to keep citations in one place. Citations are in order of appearence in the presentation.

**Title slide:** Figure taken from Chesebro et al. Challenges and Frontiers in Computational Metabolic Psychiatry. (in press). [Preprint](https://www.cambridge.org/engage/coe/article-details/66b531f95101a2ffa89ec0ff) (yes I know the citations are messy - ask me for a cleaned version or wait a month until it's published).

**Slide #1:**
1. Same image as title slide.
2. Image taken from Chesebro et al. Ion gradient-driven bifurcations of a multi-scale neuronal model. _Chaos Solitons Fractals_. 2023 Feb;167:113120. [doi: 10.1016/j.chaos.2023.113120.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37662556/)
3. Image take from Mujica-Parodi et al. Diet modulates brain network stability, a biomarker for brain aging, in young adults. _Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A_. 2020 Mar 17;117(11):6170-6177. [doi: 10.1073/pnas.1913042117](https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.1913042117?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&rfr_dat=cr_pub%20%200pubmed). 
4. Image generated with DALLE3 using ChatGPT. I'm lazy and just typed in two prompts to get this.

**Slide #2:** Mostly unpublished data - ask me if you're interested in details. Gene maps illustration from Gryglewski et al. Spatial analysis and high resolution mapping of the human whole-brain transcriptome for integrative analysis in neuroimaging. _Neuroimage_. 2018 Aug 1;176:259-267. [doi: 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2018.04.068.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1053811918303884?via%3Dihub)

**Slide #3:** Image from Baeza-Lehnert et al. Non-Canonical Control of Neuronal Energy Status by the Na+ Pump. _Cell Metab_. 2019 Mar 5;29(3):668-680.e4. [doi: 10.1016/j.cmet.2018.11.005.](https://www.cell.com/cell-metabolism/fulltext/S1550-4131(18)30682-X?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS155041311830682X%3Fshowall%3Dtrue)

**Slides #4-6:** Various figures excerpted from Chesebro et al. Ion gradient-driven bifurcations of a multi-scale neuronal model. _Chaos Solitons Fractals_. 2023 Feb;167:113120. [doi: 10.1016/j.chaos.2023.113120.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37662556/)

**Slide #7** 
1. All images except the last are from van Nieuwenhuizen et al. Ketosis regulates K+ ion channels, strengthening brain-wide signaling disrupted by age. _Imaging Neuroscience_ 2024; 2 1–14. [doi: https://doi.org/10.1162/imag_a_00163](https://direct.mit.edu/imag/article/doi/10.1162/imag_a_00163/120749/Ketosis-regulates-K-ion-channels-strengthening).
2. Final image is from Ma and Yellen. Ketogenic diet metabolites reduce firing in central neurons by opening K(ATP) channels. _J Neurosci_. 2007 Apr 4;27(14):3618-25. [doi: 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0132-07.2007](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6672398/).

**Slide #9:** 
1. Animations are in `quick_neuron_animations.jl` in this repo. You'll need Neuroblox installed, but you should really get it for all your neuron animation needs anyway so win-win!
2. Same as 1.
3. The spiking population is a simulation from the [Neuroblox tutorials](https://neuroblox.github.io/NeurobloxDocsHost/dev/) (not quite on that site but soon). It's replicating a PING network from Börgers et al. Background gamma rhythmicity and attention in cortical local circuits: a computational study. _Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A._ 2005 May 10;102(19):7002-7. [doi: 10.1073/pnas.0502366102.](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.0502366102?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&rfr_dat=cr_pub%20%200pubmed)
4. Composites of images from this slide and the next.

**Slide #10:** `probability_flux_animation.jl` http://www.physics.adelaide.edu.au/theory/staff/leinweber/VisualQCD/ImprovedOperators/index.html

**Slide #11:** 
1. Images adapted from Byrne et al. A mean field model for movement induced changes in the beta rhythm. _J Comput Neurosci_. 2017 Oct;43(2):143-158. [doi: 10.1007/s10827-017-0655-7](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5585324/).
2. Unpublished internal simulation (ask me if you want code/demo).
3. Video from supplementary material of Pang et al. Geometric constraints on human brain function. _Nature_. 2023 Jun;618(7965):566-574. [doi: 10.1038/s41586-023-06098-1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10266981/).

**Slide #12:** Unpublished data (and some ongoing experiments). If you're interested in details or want to get involved, get in touch! A couple extra resources (and citations from other papers on the slides):
* Brincat SL, Miller EK. Frequency-specific hippocampal-prefrontal interactions during associative learning. _Nat Neurosci_. 2015 Apr;18(4):576-81. [doi: 10.1038/nn.3954.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4444366/)
* Pathak et al. New learning principles emerge from biomimetic computational primitives. [Preprint](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.11.06.565902v3).
